Project Specification: Suppose you are in charge of managing the supply chain system for a vaccine manufacturing company.  There is asetnlocations, labeledv1, v2, v3, . . . , vnthat will be used to distribute and give the shots.  For each connected pair,viandvj, we have a distance functiond(vi, vj).  For any pair,d(vi, vj)>0and the distances are symmetric, i.e.d(vi, vj) =d(vj, vi).We  have  the  capacity  to  set-upkproduction  centers  anywhere  that  can  produce  the  vaccines,  but  the  vaccineis  such  that  the  bottleneck  is  in  transportation  between  sites  rather  than  the  capacity  of  production.   Assign  eachvaccination distribution location to one of thekproduction centers so as to minimize the maximum distance betweenany vaccination distribution locations.If needed, in a tie-breaking situation, your solution should keep the edge(u, v),u < v, over the edge(r, s),r < s,whenu < ror, ifu=r,v < s.
